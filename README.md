#  Digital Rain Screen Saver for MacOS

This is a custom MacOS screensaver that displays the "digital rain" from the the movie "The Matrix".

## Acknowledgments

I would be remiss not to include a link to [this article](https://zsmb.co/building-a-macos-screen-saver-in-kotlin/#preview-problems) by
[@zsmb13](https://github.com/zsmb13). This article gave me the blueprint to build a custom screensaver as the resources and discussions
surrounding the MacOS screen saver APIs are dated. If you want to build your own screen saver (and even write it in Kotlin), then I
would strongly reccommend reading zsmb's article.
